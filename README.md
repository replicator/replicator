# Replicator

A multiplayer game in which players create reproducing entities known as "replicators".  Players design replicators with a set of rules or strategies as to ensure their survival and reproduction in a world of adversarial and friendly replicators.  A game is won once a player's replicators has taken over all of the enemies' replicators, or their number exceeds their enemies after the time limit.  Players cannot manipulate replicators once the game has been started.

Inspired by Conway's Game of Life.
